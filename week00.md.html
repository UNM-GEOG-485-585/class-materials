<h1 id="goals">Goals and Objectives</h1>
<p>Internet mapping technologies are an important component of geospatial data capture, sharing, visualization, and delivery. This course provides a survey of current and emerging internet and geospatial interoperability standards, technologies, and capabilities. The emphasis of the work in this class will be hands-on experience in four critical aspects of Internet-enabled mapping:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The basic concepts behind web development and web mapping technologies that enable the delivery of maps and mapped data through web browsers</p></li>
<li><p>The Open Standards that facilitate the exchange of map images and geospatial data over the internet</p></li>
<li><p>The use of published standards-based services in desktop mapping applications that implement those standards</p></li>
<li><p>The deployment of standards-based geospatial map and data services that other systems and users may make use of</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The specific class objectives that relate to these activities and departmental curriculum objectives for undergraduate and graduate students in the Geography Department include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Students will understand the concepts geospatial data and service interoperability</p></li>
<li><p>Students will be able to define the specific requirements of a particular analysis or project and identify the interoperability standards that are capable of meeting those requirements</p></li>
<li><p>Students will be knowledgeable in the core technologies that they may use to produce their own internet-enabled mapping capabilities</p></li>
<li><p>Students will understand the strengths and limitations of current internet mapping technologies for generating cartographically effective map products.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The weekly goals, objectives and assignments are outlined below</p>
